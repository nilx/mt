# OVERVIEW

mt19937ar.c contains the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number
generator, by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.

This geneator is fast and produces good pseudo-randomness. It has a
very long period of 2^19937 âˆ’ 1 and is k-distributed to 32-bit
accuracy for every k in [1...623]. It passes rumerous tests for
statistical randomness, including the Diehard tests.

This genreator provides better randomness than the default built-in
ANSI C function rand(). Unlike the BSD/UNIX rand48() functions, this
implementation is portable.

The original code has been slightly amended to keep only the core
functions.

## SOURCE

http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html

# LICENSE

Like the original version, this code can be used for any purpose,
includiong commercial use.

# REQUIREMENTS

mt19937ar.c is ANSI C, and should compile on any system with any ANSI C 
compiler.

# USAGE

Compile mt19937ar.c with your program, and include mt19937ar.h to get the
function declarations.

Initialize the random number generator with mt_init_genrand().

Get a random number in [0, 1) with 53 random bits (the maximum
randomness for such number in double-precision) with mt_genrand_res53().

## EXAMPLE

    #include <time.h>
    #include <mt19937ar.h>

    double foo;

    /*
     * a possible (weak) initialization
     * uses the current time, in seconds
     */
    mt_init_genrand((unsigned long int) time(NULL));

    /*
     * now we can get a pseudo-random value
     */
    foo = mt_genrand_res53();

# TODO

* provide examples of better yet portable initializations
