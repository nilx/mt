# OVERVIEW

mt.c contains the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator, by
Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto (mt19937ar.c).

This geneator is fast and produces good pseudo-randomness. It has a
very long period of 2^19937 âˆ’ 1 and is k-distributed to 32-bit
accuracy for every k in [1...623]. It passes rumerous tests for
statistical randomness, including the Diehard tests.

This genreator provides better randomness than the default built-in
ANSI C function rand(). Unlike the BSD/UNIX rand48() functions, this
implementation is portable.

The original code has been slightly amended to keep only the core
functions.

## SOURCE

# LICENSE

Like the original version, this code can be used for any purpose,
includiong commercial use.

# REQUIREMENTS

mt.c is ANSI C, and should compile on any system with any ANSI C
compiler.

# USAGE

Compile mt.c with your program, and include mt.h to get the function
declarations.

Initialize the random number generator with mt_init().

Get a random number in [0, 1) with 53 random bits (the maximum
randomness for such number in double-precision) with mt_drand53().

## EXAMPLE

see example.c

# TODO

* provide examples of better yet portable initializations
* integer variant
